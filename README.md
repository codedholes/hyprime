# hyprime
A tool for finding Mersenne-primes.

It's made using Visual Studio. Please edit it with Visual Studio.
Compiling is already done. The binaries are found in /bin/x64/release.
The primes are stored in "p.txt", next to the executable by default.
The last checked power is stored in "l.txt". If you wish to find new and bigger primes, feel free to change this number.

It uses the Lucas-Lehmer primality test for checking wether an integer is prime or not.
